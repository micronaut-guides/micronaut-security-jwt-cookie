Create the next configuration file:

[source,yaml]
.src/main/resources/application.yaml
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/application.yml[tags=security]
----

<1> Enable Cookie authentication.
<2> If the login fails, redirect to `/login/authFailed`
<3> You can create a http://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/api/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/secret/SecretSignatureConfiguration.html[SecretSignatureConfiguration] named `generator` via configuration as illustrated above. The `generator` signature is used to sign the issued JWT claims.
<4> Change this by your own secret and keep it safe.
