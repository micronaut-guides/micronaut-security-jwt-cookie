Create the next configuration file:

[source,groovy]
.src/main/resources/application.yaml
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

<1> Enable Micronaut's security capabilities
<2> Expose /login endpoint
<3> Expose /logout endpoint
<4> Enable JWT based authentication
<5> Disable Bearer Token support.
<6> Enable Cookie Token support.
<7> If the login fails, redirect him to /login/authFailed
<8> You can create a http://docs.micronaut.io/api/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/secret/SecretSignatureConfiguration.html[SecretSignatureConfiguration] named `generator` via configuration as illustrated above. The `generator` signature is used to sign the issued JWT claims.
<9> Change this by your own secret and keep it safe.
