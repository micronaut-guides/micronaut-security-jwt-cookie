Create the next configuration file:

[source,yaml]
.src/main/resources/application.yaml
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

<1> Expose `/login` endpoint
<2> Expose `/logout` endpoint
<3> Disable Bearer Token support.
<4> Enable Cookie Token support.
<5> If the login fails, redirect to `/login/authFailed`
<6> You can create a http://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/api/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/secret/SecretSignatureConfiguration.html[SecretSignatureConfiguration] named `generator` via configuration as illustrated above. The `generator` signature is used to sign the issued JWT claims.
<7> Change this by your own secret and keep it safe.
